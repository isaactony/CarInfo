# Car Market Analyzer Database Documentation

## Overview
The Car Market Analyzer database is designed to support the backend functionality of the Car Market Analyzer application. It stores all necessary data related to cars, users, and market trends.

## Database Setup
To set up the database, execute the SQL commands in the `schema.sql` file located in this directory. This file contains the necessary SQL statements to create the required tables and relationships.

## Tables
The database schema includes the following tables:

- **Cars**: Stores information about each car, including make, model, year, specifications, and pricing data.
- **Users**: Contains user information for managing user accounts and preferences.
- **Price Trends**: Records historical price data for cars to facilitate price analysis and trend visualization.

## Usage
Once the database is set up, the backend application will interact with it through the defined repository interfaces, allowing for CRUD operations and data retrieval for the application features.

## Maintenance
Regular maintenance of the database is recommended to ensure optimal performance and data integrity. This includes monitoring for any anomalies in data and performing backups as necessary.

## Additional Information
